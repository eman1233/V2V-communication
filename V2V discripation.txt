                      V2V communication System
                      System disripatin
					  
1- using two microcontrollers to communicate with others using UART

2- every microcontroller has 
         1- Front ultrasonic: to measure front distance
		    Back ultrasonic: to measure back distance
		 2-Camera: to Know if accidant happen or not
		 ("I using switch instead of camera because camera
		   not exist in simulation")
		  3-LCD: to show the massage come from another microcontroller
		  4-Alarm System:to indication
		  5-Motors : to move the car in certain direction
		  
3- MCAL Layer:
      1-ICU         2-DIO
	  3-UART
	  
4-HAL Layer:
      1-Ultrasonic         2-Motors
	  3-Alarm System       4-LCD
	  5-Camera   

5-Service Layer:
        Operating System  "FreeRtos"

6-System Funcationality:
    there are two cars with 2 MCU communicate with each other using uart
    
	in any car:
      **if any car detect object in destance < 30 cm using Back or front ultrasonic this car tell another 
      and this car detect certain direction to take it another car take certain
      desion to avoid this error and accidant is not happen and LCD show distance and massage

      **if any car detect an accidant using camera this car tell another car an accidant happen and using ultrasonic 
      this car measure distance and tell another

     **if any car make an accident , alarm system worked and tell another car 
     I make an accidant
